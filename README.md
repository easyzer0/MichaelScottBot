# Michael Scott Quotes

This is a fun Django app that I created where users can add their phone numbers
to a text messaging list that sends daily Michael Scott (The Office)
quotes to all members. I created a REST API in order to pull the information (phone numbers, names) from
the database and run it through the text messaging script, which uses Twilio to send automated texts.
